# LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions to various LeetCode problems. It serves as a log of my problem-solving journey and progress in coding challenges.

## About This Repository

This is my personal collection of LeetCode solutions as I work through different problems. Each solution represents my approach at the time of solving, and I may revisit problems to improve solutions as I learn new techniques.

## Structure

Solutions are simply named according to the LeetCode problem number or title. I focus on solving the problems rather than maintaining a specific organizational structure.

## Languages Used

I primarily solve problems using:
- Python
- Java
- JavaScript

## Purpose

This repository serves several personal purposes:
- Track my progress through LeetCode challenges
- Document my problem-solving approaches
- Reference my solutions when reviewing similar problems
- Observe my improvement over time

## Notes

- Solutions include my thought process and approach
- Time and space complexity may be noted in comments
- This is a personal log rather than a tutorial or guide
